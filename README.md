# GIT FOR BEGINNERS

# INTRODUCTION
In module, we will be focusing on mastering Git from a theoretical and practical perspective.  Software development requires a lot of efforts in coding, collaboration, testing etc.  It is repetitive and could
work sometimes and other times may not work - sadly so. 

Software development comes with ups and downs: great code, bugs, smell code, emerging requirements, fixes etc. 

Hence, we need some sort of   so we can revert back to when things were working smoothly.  

It's like working with say, Microsoft Word or a graphics software where we save checkpoints 
that can be reverted to in case we have say, a sudden power outage.  

Likewise we need checkpoints in software development too; and this is known as VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM.

Once again, the goal here is not to memorise thousands of commands in Git but to understand the workflow of Git in the making of a software.  What happens behind the scene in Git?

# Definition
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  
Source: https://git-scm.com

# REQUIREMENTS
1.  Visual Studio code
2.  Git

Note: Git and GitHub are totally different - GitHub is a service provider and Git is a software in itself.  Note that Git is a terminal-first VCS.  We will be deep-diving into GitHub in coming modules.

So let's get started with Git...

#  DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL GIT
1.  Download Git from https://git-scm.com
2.  Click on Downloads and it will automatically detect your system OS and you can download Git.
3.  After download, open the file and follow the on-screen promts (Next buttons, Agree button) and it's done!

After installation, we now proceed to learning the software...  

Note: Clicking on Documentation > Reference Manuals on https://git-scm opens up loads of info when you click on the git or command buttons.  So how do you find your way around?  This is more of a reference guide!

# FIRST THINGS FIRST
1.  Create a folder where all our Git files would reside on your laptop, say gitspace
2.  cd to that folder
3.  Ensure you have nothing (files or subdirectories in that folder)
4.  Create 3 directories in this folder (e.g. using mkdir commands, create folders gitspace1, gitspace2 and gitspace3)
