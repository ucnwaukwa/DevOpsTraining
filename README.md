# Git for Beginners
In module, we will be focusing on mastering Git from a theoretical and practical perspective.  Software development requires a lot of efforts in coding, collaboration, testing etc.  It is repetitive and could
work sometimes and other times may not work - sadly so. 

To handle bad days, we need some sort of checkpoint so we can revert back to when things were working smoothly.  It's like working with say, Microsoft Word or a graphics software where we save checkpoints 
that can be reverted to in case we have say, a sudden power outage.  Hence, this is known as VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM.
